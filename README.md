CODING CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction
Complete the challenge in the link below in the time given. Your goal is to code the best solution you can in the time given.
A working solution is important, but don’t forget that the quality of the design and the clarity of the code are important as well. If you run into any ambiguities in the requirements, you may choose how to resolve them: just make sure that you document your choice.
If you run out of time, don’t panic! Send your partial solution and write down what you would have done given more time.


Rules
1.   You may use any programming language and development environment you choose for this challenge. This could be C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc. It could be designed to run in a window, on the command line, or through a web browser… you choose! The only restriction is that your final solution must be able to run on Windows.
2.   If your solution requires external libraries, files, or software to run, please package them with your solution into your GitHub repository. If we can't get your solution to run, how can we evaluate your work?
3.   All of the code you write must be your own. The solution to this challenge can easily be found on the Internet, but we trust you to not look it up. You can use the Internet for clarification of language syntax, etc. but the code must be your own.
4.   You can use any external libraries that you think would help if it doesn't solve the core components of the problem. You can use whatever text or electronic documentation you choose to look up library functions.
5.   There is a time limit of 4 hours. Before beginning the challenge, please make sure you have 4 continuous hours to devote to it; once you begin, take no more than 4 hours to work on the challenge (if you can do it to your satisfaction in less, great!)
6.   The contents of this challenge are confidential. Please do not share information about the challenge with anyone else.
